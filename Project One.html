      <h2> MOVIES AND CARTOONS</h2>
      <h4> Introduction</h4>
      <p>We all know that movies are basically motion pictures that are moved at a very fast speed. The movies are created to mainly connect with people's emotions and sense of imagination. It is said that what makes one human is one's ability to feel and have emotions. Today technology disagrees with that with the introduction of AI and IoT. AI and IoT has led to the creation of robots and Nano sensors that imitate the the humanbeing in every perspective.
          There are all kinds of movies for every kind of human. Yes! I said it. We humans are very different and we need to appreciate and accept that. We are brought up in society that ditactes how one show eat, sleep, speak and live. This saphocates some people because the end up acting just to keep up with society which is not right. We always leave the acting to the movies. Oh! Right back to movies. We have the romance for the softiees, action for adredaline junkies, adventure for imaginatives, documentaries for the realists and so on.
      </p>
      <p>Today Cartoons are disguised as animations. This is for the adults not feel guilty or ashamed if found watching one. Originally, society had created this myth of cartoon being only for children. Its a myth because an adult can perfectly watch and enjoy a decent cartoon. I come to realise that sometimes society is not all that bad. It probably put up all these rules for a reason. Forexample now  that today, Adults can comfortably watch cartoon, this has led to the production of PG cartoons. Cartoons that diminishes a child's innocence and right to be a child. They include all kind words and scenes that are not appropriate for children put in a cartoon that is supposed to bbe for children to watch.
          We need to watch out. Have stop point. Because now, one cannot just buy any cartoon and let the children watch. One has to first watch it to ensure that it is children friendly. This is what Society was probaably saving us from.
